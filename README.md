This is a personal project developed for the '*Human Computer Interaction and Information Visualization*' [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it) master's degree course.

The main goal of this project was to provide a design solution for the visualization of environmental data (Co2, Humidity, Luminosity, Wind Speed, Pressure, ...) at different levels of granularity for various types of users.

It has been designed three different information visualization tools conceived as:
* An app for smartphone/smartwatch for letting the user to access the environmental data of the single station placed near to the user (current data and historical data) and to offer some kind of comparison with the other stations;
* An information visualization tool for the end users, designed as an ambient display to be delivered in a public space;
* An information visualization tool, designed as an application for large tablets or desktop/laptop computers for letting back end technical personnel staff to access data at different levels of granularity (single station, subsets of stations) for monitoring the status of CO2, identifying patterns related to the relation between CO2 and the other environmental variables monitored by the system.
